I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at [LAILA](https://sites.google.com/view/lailaunimi), University of Milan, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Nicol√≤ Cesa-Bianchi](https://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/).
I am also affiliated with the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/computer-science-and-systems-engineering) in Genoa, where I am supervised by Prof. [Massimiliano Pontil](https://www.iit.it/people/massimiliano-pontil).

My research interests broadly lie in _Online Learning_ and _Machine Learning Theory_.
One of the key focuses of my research is to understand the interplay between feedback models and the hardness of sequential decision-making problems.
I am also generally interested in their intersection with other areas of machine learning, such as Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory, and Optimization.
